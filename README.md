codebreaker
===========

Working through the RSpec book. Codebreaker is the example command line game.

The game generates a secret code made up of four digits between the numbers of 1 and 6. The player makes a guess at the
number and receives feedback from the computer based upon accuracy of guess. For each number that is correctly guessed 
in the correct position, the player will see a "+", whereas for each number guessed correctly in an incorrect position,
the player will see a "-". If the number guessed is not in the secret code, then the user will see " ".
